**Technology stack：** vue3 + vuex + vue-router + webpack + sass + element-plus

## Installation dependency

Run `npm install` to generate component.

## Development server

```shell
# Node version below 17
$ npm run serve

# Node version 17 and above
$ npm run serve_t # (windows system)
$ npm run serve_u
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build project

```shell
# Build test projects
$ npm run build:testnet_t / npm run build:testnet_u / npm run build:testnet

# Build production projects
$ npm run build:prod_t / npm run build:prod_u / npm run build:prod
# You can use the npm run build command without any suffix if you are using a version of Node lower than 16, or you should use the command with the suffix name if you are using a version higher than 16
# The only difference between _t and _u is that _t uses the set keyword while _u uses the export keyword, and how you use it depends on which keyword your system supports.
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist` directory.
